# Lavanya Portfolio

# This is the repository for my data analysis projects 
* I have completed my Google Data Analytics course with honors.
* I completed learning several programming languages such as Tableu, Excel, SQL and R etc to work on my Data analysis assignments. 
* I have finished the Capstone project at the end of the course which deals with bike sharing analysis of a fictitious company called "Cyclistic". I have completed this analysis in Excel and also in R which gave me high confidence in doing practical Data analysis. 

# [Here is my Capstone project details with R-code and the summary of the observations](https://github.com/Lavanya2507/Project)
